/**
 *  Transport class
 *
 *  Version 1.2 now reads from the SMTP port and reports errors in a more robust fashion.
 *  It also implements the Transportable interface.
 *
 *  Version 1.1.1 includes a minor bugfix.
 *  This line in the send method:
 *    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter( s.getOutputStream(), true );
 *  was fixed. (Thanks to Jon Barber.)
 *
 *  This class is the class that actually sends an email by talking to an SMTP
 *  server.
 *
 *  What's changed in 1.1 (most changes to 1.1 occured in THIS class)
 *    1.  Improved the FROM field a little so that the correct error is thrown if
 *        the FROM is not included. (It's required inorder to send an email.)
 *    2.  Fixed the behavior of the "To" and "Cc" fields. In 1.0, multiple To's
 *        or Cc's would display as multiple copies of the first email address.
 *        There was no problem in sending, just displaying.
 *    3.  Brackets are no longer printed for a single email address:
 *        Before: <bill@coolservlets.com>
 *        After:  bill@coolservlets.com
 *
 *  SMTP documentation (RFC821) can be found at:
 *    http://freesoft.org/CIE/RFC/821/index.htm
 *
 *  This class also checks for errors. An exception is thrown if a connection
 *  to the SMTP server cannot be established.
 *  The message itself must have the FROM and TO fields specified. (Acutally,
 *  to send an email through SMTP, you don't need a FROM field. I decided to
 *  require it to prevent totally anonymous emails. However, you could take
 *  that requirement out if you wanted to.)
 *
 *  Here's how this class should be used:
 *
 *  Message msg = new Message(); // fill this up, ie, FROM, TO's, etc... (see Message class)
 *  Transport tr = new Transport( "yourHost.com", 25 ); // SMTP ports are 25 by default
 *
 *  try {
 *      tr.send( msg );
 *  }
 *  catch( TransportExeception te ) {
 *      System.err.println( "TransportException! " + te );
 *  }
 *
