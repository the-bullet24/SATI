/**
 *  Address class
 *
 *  This class is designed to store an email address.
 *
 *  An email address is defined in the following way:
 *    a <name> and an <address>  (ie, "Bill Lynch" <bill@coolservlets.com>)
 *    or just an <address>  (ie, <bill@coolservlets.com)
 *
 *  A <name> is any string that does NOT contain the ASCII characters, 0-31,
 *  127 and 34. (Control characters, DEL, and quotes).
 *
 *  An <address> is any string that does NOT contain the ASCII character, 0-31,
 *  127 and 34. (Control characters, DEL, and quotes). Additionally, it must
 *  have a "@" symbol and it must not have any spaces.
 *
 *  When an email address or email name is added, it's checked for validity. A
 *  MalformedAddressException will be thrown if something isn't right.
 *  Additionally, the email will not be stored.
 *
 *  Changes in ver 1.2:
 *    Improved some of the documentation and changed the error strings in the
 *    setAddress() and setPersonal() methods.
 *
